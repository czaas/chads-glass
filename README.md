# Chads Glass

[http://chads-glass.czaas.com/](http://chads-glass.czaas.com/)

Rebuilt this (old repos: [1](https://github.com/czaas/chad-www) [2](https://github.com/czaas/panacea-glass)) app using [hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) which let me get away from complex structures when using react but still utilizing a virtual DOM and a simple API. 

This app pulls in the first 20 posts from Chads instagram page and displays them in a simple grid. The Modal will popup on click and allow you to browser through the individual posts.
